  We propose a secure and verifiable distributed document representation outsourcing scheme based on the FBoW model in cloud computing. This scheme employs a novel blind method based on orthogonal symmetric matrices to preserve privacy and minimize computational overhead, achieving a 95.42% improvement in performance.
